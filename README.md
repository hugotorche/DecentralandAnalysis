## **The Trends and Influences of Metaverse NFTs**

### **Analyzing Decentraland Marketplace**

## **Abstract**

This paper aims to analyze the fluctuations of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT) trades on Metaverse Applications. To do that, we analyzed the Marketplace of one of the biggest Gaming applications and Metaverse on the Blockchain: Decentraland. Using The Graph protocol, we retrieved orders data from the last 1000 blocks of data for all categories but decided to focus the analysis on Estate transactions. The research also includes the potential influences that could impact the Marketplace activity and, more especially, the relation with Cryptocurrencies variations of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Decentraland. NFTs and Metaverse concepts, as well as the company application,  are defined in the introduction and framework section of this paper. 

Data has been split into two different datasets: Decentraland Marketplace data, and Cryptocurrencies variations. We used two of the most reliable APIs from the sector to perform our Data Sourcing: The Graph protocol and Coin Gecko API. The paper mainly focuses on data collection, processing, and analysis using the following tools: GraphQL, Python, and Tableau. The Visual Analysis concludes that the Marketplace activity is highly volatile with significant upward variations. At the same time, the general trend showed that transactions were slightly decreasing. Finally, the analysis provided a nuanced correlation with Cryptocurrencies which may suggest the presence of other influencing factors.
